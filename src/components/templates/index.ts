/**
 * Template Components Module
 *
 * Re-export location for page-level layout components that define content structure.
 * Previously contained Header and Footer which have been moved to organisms.
 *
 * @module components/templates
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module now serves as a placeholder. Header and Footer components
 * have been reorganized under the organisms directory for better alignment
 * with Atomic Design principles.
 *
 * For Header and Footer, import from:
 * ```typescript
 * import { Header, Footer } from '@/components/ui';
 * ```
 *
 * Other template components like Container, Section, and ResultsInfo
 * are also exported from the main UI module.

// Header and Footer have been moved to /organisms
// They are exported from @/components/ui instead
